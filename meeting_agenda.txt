1. Background
- necessary knowledge:
	- graph, Laplacian
	- graph data/signals, signal variation (signal processing)
	- recommender system
		- users, items, ratings (UI matrix) 
		- user-similarity, item similarity
		- Collaborative filtering, SLIM 

2. Project
- what is this project?
	- using graph signal processing techniques for recommender systems
	- model recommendation problem as a graph signal reconstruction/interpolation problem, then use graph signal processing techniques to do recommendation
	- unsupervised learning or supervised? i.e., do we need training?  
	- goal: rating prediction, ranking (top n-recommendation)
- why? 
	- recommender system 
	- graph as a model for networked data
	-  help understand modern recommendation algorithms based on graph neural networks
- different subquestions
	- carry the same methodology
	- performance may vary with different dataset 
	- allocation: 
		- Karolis
		- Lars
		- Melle
		- Rafael
		- Serenic
		
		

3. To do before next meeting (next friday preferred) 
- paper readings
	- shuman2013: graph signal processing overview
		-Section II: graph, edge weights, graph Laplacian, graph signals, graph signal smoothness
		-Section III: Example 2
	- sandryhaila 2014: graph signal and understand its variation
		- Section II-a 
		- Section III (signal variation)
		- Section VI-B (tikhonov vs total variation)
	- aggarwal: recommender systems
		- chapter 1: 1.3 - 1.3.1 (CF model)
		- chapter 2: can skip 2.4, 2.5 
			- user-CF
			- item-CF
			- regression model: SLIM
			- graph models for neighbourhood CF methods 
	- ning2011L SLIM for top-N recommendations
- familiar with dataset
	- ML-100K 
- similarity choice, evaluation metrics 
- research question formulation 
	- given UI-matrix, build UU or II similarity graphs
	- formulate the rating prediction problem 
	- solve the problem and perform prediction 

4. logistics 
- working with each other
- weekly meeting (one student)
- course tasks (presentations, posters, drafts) 
	- we can provide help and comments
	- drafts are important 
- assessment method: provided in brightspace
