1. ways to investigate different regularizers 
    - tikhonov regularizer
    - sobolov regularizer
    - total variation 
    - graph trend filtering 

2. ways to solve the optimization problem 
    - solving strategy in the matrix form or in the form of vector by vector: 
        -A: in general, we suggest, for instance, considering a UU graph, to solve the optimization problem item by item, i.e., predict the ratings of all users (all nodes of the graph) given to one specific item,, then do this for each item  
        -B: solve in the matrix form

    - solvers: 
        -a: closed form solution 
        -b: iterative solvers, admm, cg, sgd
        -c: convex solvers  


    - tikhonov regularizer: A or B, a 
    - SLIM: A is suggested in the paper, b
    - total variation: A is suggested, b
    - gran trend filtering: A is suggesed, b   

3. Some questions
    - what if the preicted results went out of the feasible range, e.g., predicted as 6 while the reasonable range is [1,5]?
        - constrained optimization?
