1. Literature reading feedback
- Questions? 
    - isufi's: 
        - graph representations, adjacency matrix, incidence matrix, laplacians and their variants, graph shift operator
        - graph spectra
        - graph signals, multivariate graph signal 
        - graph diffusions based on adjacency matrix and laplacian, local operation 
        - signal variation (based on laplacian and based on adjacency matrix as in moura's paper)
            - graph laplacian quadratic form, tikhonov regularizer
            - signal total vairation, based on adjacency matrix, observed better performance 
        - regularization 
            - tikhonov regularizer eq.2.17
            - total variation regularization eq.2.37

    - survey paper on recsys: 
        - recsys language, user, item, ratings ... 
        - rating prediction, evaluation: MAE, RMSE
        - neighbouring-based preditions 
            - eq.6/7
        - item based 
            - eq. 11/12
        - rating normalization 
            - mean centering 
            - z-score normalization 
        - similarity weight computation 
            - person correlation ...
        - section 5 also introduces SLIM method ...

    - ning2011 SLIM:
        - learning based method, basically learn the contribution weights from neighbours
        - understand the optimization problem 3 



2. build a graph from rating matrix data 
- user-user similarity graph or item-item one
- weights? similarity .. 
- what will be the graph signals on this graph? 
- solutions ... for later 
- formulate the problem 
- baseline methods? 
- consider a real data and discuss the procedures 

3. subproblem allocation 
- Karolis
- Lars
- Melle 
- Rafael
- Serenic 

4. project plan
- build graph 
- test baseline methods
- use the training data to, foor instance, build the graph or learn the weights in SLIM, test
- performance reports
- investigation
